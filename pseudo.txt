The goal of pipex is to simulate pipes | in the shell.
Pipex has to reproduce exactly the shell command:

./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2

will behave like:

< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2

for example:

< test.txt grep hello | wc -w >  outfile

- < symbol = input redirection
    - it redirects the content of infile to stdin, so that when grep reads from stdin, it gets the content of infile.
- | symbol = output redirection
    - redirects the output of grep to the input of wc -w.
- >> symbol = input appendment
    - appends the output of left command to the end of outfile.
- << symbol = input "redirection"
    - reads from stdin until encounters a specific limiter on stdin.
    - cmd << LIMITER | cmd1 >> file

pipes are usually represented as file descriptor pairs, read end and write end.

main checklist

- check the existence of infile and outfile
- be sure to understand what > does when the file does not exist
- create the necessary pipe(s)
- create a child process for each command (1 for mandatory, multiple for bonus)
    - (remember that when using here_doc, it is the 2nd arg, so not a command)
- wait for all the processes to end before writing to the outfile

execute checklist
- remember that execve() needs the path to a binary file as parameter
    - find where the commands binaries are stored on your computer
    - before going further, you have to know how to find any command binary
- check in all possible locations if the binary (command) requested by the user exists
- "build" the arguments array for the command
- execute the command using execve()

find PATH, if PATH is not found, exit with error(will  be tested in eval with unset PATH)
if command is .g. ls

execute command

dup2 = opens fd, infile and outfile, close the rest

if 1st command fails, exit code is 0, if second cmd fails, exit code is 127

when process id = 0, it is the child process 

pid == 0  || pid != 0 <-- are you the child, or are you the parent?

exevce overwrites all memory, replaces with new values based on what is passed into it

if execve == -1,  exec_error
